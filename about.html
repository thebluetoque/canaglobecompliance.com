				<h1>LOGO STORY</h1>
				<p>Our logo starts with a traffic light - its three colours and three-circle shape. A traffic light requires cooperation and compliance. Like we do, it signals go, caution or stop.</p>
				<p>The traffic light is fragmented into three ‘C’ shapes (C for CanaGlobe) superimposed and slightly offset. This arrangement creates a clockwise rotating movement, the ‘C’ shapes fitting together to form order (solutions) and a complete circle (globe).</p>
				<p>The ‘C’s are transparent. This allows more complex colours and shapes to form, reflecting the more complex aspects of compliance. Underneath though, we see the foundation is stable.</p>
				<p>Finally, the three ‘C’s represent CanaGlobe's business philosophy:  Clear, Calm Communication.</p>
